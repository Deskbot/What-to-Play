An alternative way to get Steam review data is using this api call: https://store.steampowered.com/broadcast/ajaxgetbatchappcapsuleinfo?appids=${appId}

Unfortunately it only contains total review numbers and not recent reviews.

This is probably a quicker way of getting data because Steam probably queries less data and it's slower to parse HTML and use Cheerio than JSON.

The score that GOG shows in the search menu is sometimes missing (0) when there is a score on the product page.

In the case of Cyberpunk 2077, the search menu shows 5 stars but the product page shows <4 stars.

How long to beat doesn't have very helpful classes where it displays the timings in the search results.

It uses "--" instead of some text when there is not enough data or the game isn't out.

String similarity:

I think Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance is overkill because all websites except opencritic show nothing if you have letters flipped

Levenshtein distance will probably do. All the other string algorithms I've looked at account for things I don't think we need to consider

The main trouble with matching is when your game's name is a substring of another e.g. Hollow vs Hollow Knight, Dark Souls vs Dark Souls 2. Levenshtein distance will prefer the shorter names.
